"""Ingestion: turn source memories into graph nodes + edges.

The graph is built by reading the source memories through their public APIs
(`all_rows`, `get_user_state`, `baseline`, …) — **never** by writing back to
them. This keeps the modules independent: the source memories stay the source
of truth, the graph is a derived view.

Ingestion drivers, one per source memory family:

- :func:`ingest_emotion` — SelfNode baseline + one RelationEdge per known user.
- :func:`ingest_summaries` — one PersonNode per `user_summary` row.
- :func:`ingest_facts` — one FactNode per `user_facts` row plus entities
  extracted by bounded batched LLM calls, with FactEdges from each fact's
  subject (Person / Entity / Self) to the fact.
- :func:`ingest_episodes` — one EpisodeNode per `episodic` row plus
  EpisodeEdges to every participant.
- :func:`ingest_wiki` — flat, no-LLM fallback: header chunks -> FactNodes.
- :func:`ingest_wiki_llm` — semantic wiki ingest: sections -> internal
  FactNodes (provenance anchors), atomic visible FactNodes, scored
  PersonNodes/RelationEdges, EntityNodes (named things), and EpisodeNodes
  (story events).

Entity/people extraction is **context-aware and relevance-filtered**. Both the
fact-extraction and wiki-extraction prompts are told:

- *who the character is* (name + persona) — the lens for "relevant to the
  character";
- *what is already in the graph* (existing entity names, known people) — so the
  LLM reuses an existing name rather than minting a synonym (Phonewave /
  PhoneWave / PhoneWave (Original) collapse to one node);
- the **named-vs-generic** rule (a *Phonewave* is an entity, a generic
  *microwave* is not) and the **relevant-person** rule (a friend/rival gets a
  PersonNode; a famous person mentioned only in passing does not).

Co-occurrence: facts and episodes that share participants get a
`CoOccurrenceEdge(co_create=True)` after each batch.

The functions take already-loaded rows/items so the same code path serves the
initial full ingest (`KnowledgeGraphRetriever.ingest`) and the incremental
post-extraction update (`KnowledgeGraphRetriever.update`).

    "stable canonical `key` (lowercase, no spaces — e.g. 'okabe'), their most formal "
    "`name`, every other name/nickname in `aliases` (so 'Okabe', 'Rintaro Okabe', "
    "'Hououin Kyouma' collapse into ONE person), and a `relevance` level:\n"
    "   - protagonist: the character themselves or a co-lead;\n"
    "   - close: a main companion / love interest / family the character is close to;\n"
    "   - supporting: a recurring character the character actually interacts with;\n"
    "   - background: a named character who only appears in passing;\n"
    "   - mentioned: someone merely referenced (including famous real people — "
    "Einstein, Mozart, etc. — unless they are genuinely part of the story).\n"
    "   Reuse the SAME `key` across sections for the same person. If the person "

    "minting a variant. Also estimate the character's relationship to that person "
    "from this source only: signed valence/trust/affection in [-1,1] and a short "
    "comment; use zero and an empty comment when the source gives no signal.\n"
    "2. ENTITIES — *named, distinctive* things in the character's world only: "
    "places, organizations, objects, concepts. Same rule as facts: the Phonewave / "
    "IBN 5100 / D-Mail / Future Gadget Lab are entities; a generic microwave / "
    "camera / lab coat / hotel / database is NOT. Each entity `kind` MUST be one of: "
    "place | organization | object | concept. If a catalog entity is the same "
    "thing under an abbreviation, nickname, capitalization, or longer/shorter "
    "name, return its exact `existing_id`; never invent an id.\n"
    "3. FACTS — split the section into short, self-contained semantic facts. "
    "For each, calculate importance in [0,1], set `self_included` only when the "
    "fact is about or directly involves the character, and reference people/entities "
    "using their exact keys. Do not copy the full source chunk into a fact.\n"
    "4. is_event — true if the section describes a story event/episode; if so, give "
    "a non-empty one-sentence event_summary, importance, participant keys, and the "
    "character's sparse emotional_shift on the configured axes. Set the shift to "
    "{{}} when the character does not participate. `self_present` controls only the "
