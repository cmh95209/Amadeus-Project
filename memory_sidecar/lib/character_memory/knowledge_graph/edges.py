"""Knowledge-graph edge types.

Edges carry the relationship-specific data described in the design doc. All
edges are directed (`src` -> `dst`); `TransitionEdge` and `CoOccurrenceEdge`
are *conceptually* undirected and the graph treats them symmetrically when
walking neighbours, but they are still stored once with a canonical
`(src, dst)` ordering so (de)serialisation is unambiguous.

Like nodes, edges are plain dataclasses with `to_dict` / `from_dict`.
