"""Knowledge-graph retrieval for character memories.

An optional, additive retriever that ingests from the existing memory
systems (`user_facts`, `user_summary`, `emotion`, `episodic`) into a
per-character knowledge graph and retrieves via spreading activation with
ACT-R base-level learning and Hebbian co-occurrence reinforcement.

The source memories are the source of truth; the graph is a derived view
and never writes back to them.

See :doc:`docs/knowledge_graph` for the full design.
