"""Activation functions: bounded ACT-R-style retention + spreading activation.

Two pieces, kept pure (no I/O, no globals) so they are easy to test and so
the retriever can compose them:

- :func:`base_level_activation` — ACT-R power-law retention anchored to node
  creation, with bounded familiarity from prompt exposure.
- :func:`spread_activation` — Anderson-style spreading over the graph, up to
  a configurable number of hops, weighted by edge strength and the fan-out
  of the source node.

The retrieval-time weight of an edge `w_uv` blends the edge's own `weight`
with the destination node's importance/confidence/emotion magnitude. Those
factors live on the concrete edge/node classes; this module reads them via
small accessor helpers so it stays decoupled from the dataclasses.
