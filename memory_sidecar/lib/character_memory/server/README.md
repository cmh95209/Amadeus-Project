# CharacterMemory server (`character_memory.server`)

A small FastAPI app that exposes the `CharacterAgent` over HTTP using a
two-step "thin client" chat flow:

1. **`POST /context`** — load (or create) a chat for a character + user,
   store the user's message, and return the assembled memory context.
2. **`POST /save`** — store the assistant answer the client generated and run
   memory extraction so the character learns from the exchange.

This lets a client use its own LLM/model and only rely on the server for
memory recall and learning. The core library does **not** depend on FastAPI;
`fastapi` and `uvicorn` are pulled in only by the optional `server` extra.

The bundled WebUI at **`/gui`** is also a memory observatory and character
workshop. SQLite-backed memories (`user_facts`, `user_directives`, `episodic`,
`heartbeat`, `user_summary`) and per-user emotion state can be added, edited,
and deleted directly from the Archive view. RAG chunks and the knowledge graph
are intentionally read-only because their source of truth is the character's
files; edit those under Workshop → Files and rebuild the indexes instead.

---

## Install

```bash
pip install charactermemory[server]
```

## Guided setup

The decision-model step offers `none`, `typesafe`, `openrouter`, or `llm`.
Native providers prompt for a model ID and API key; `llm` reuses the chat model
and credentials. Selecting a provider enables deduplication by default via
`CM_DEDUP_ENABLED=true`. Setup saves `CM_DECISION_PROVIDER` and
`CM_DECISION_MODEL` in `.env`, plus `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
when configured. Per-character `memory.dedup` settings take precedence.
Selecting `none` clears the decision provider/model while preserving the
existing deduplication toggle for legacy matching.

Run the wizard from the directory where you intend to start the server:

```bash
charactermemory-server-setup
charactermemory-server
```

The wizard creates or updates `.env` in that directory. It configures:

- LLM and embeddings base URLs (normally ending in `/v1`), models, and API keys.
  Embeddings can share the LLM key or use `OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY`.
- SQLite storage, or an existing PostgreSQL database via `CM_DATABASE_URL`.
  PostgreSQL can use local FAISS/BM25 indexes or PostgreSQL search with
  pgvector >= 0.8 installed in the database's `public` schema.
- Character and saved-data directories, bind host/port, and optional server
  authentication. The server key is separate from your provider API keys.

Enter keeps a default. Credentials use hidden input; existing secrets can be
kept, changed, or cleared, and a server key can be generated. The summary hides
credentials, including database URLs. Generated keys are available in the
saved `.env`. Saving uses an atomic replacement with owner-only permissions on
POSIX; Ctrl-C or declining the save leaves your existing file intact. Rerunning
the command preserves unrelated settings and comments.

Connection tests are optional and skipped by default. Enabling them sends one
small chat request and one embedding request, which may incur provider usage,
plus read-only PostgreSQL queries when selected. Failures allow retrying,
revising the configuration, or saving anyway. Tests do not create schemas or
install extensions. They check the draft settings; a character's YAML may
override those settings when the server starts.

The wizard does not install dependencies, provision services, migrate existing
data, create character folders, or start the server. Missing extras are reported
with installation commands (PostgreSQL needs `pip install 'charactermemory[postgres]'`).
Create characters in the GUI after startup, or put existing character folders
under `CM_ASSETS_DIR`. The server creates saved-data directories when needed.

Exported environment variables override `.env`; explicit server flags override
`CM_HOST` and `CM_PORT`. Per-character `config.yaml` overrides the corresponding
library defaults. Relative paths resolve from the server's working directory.
Database namespaces are left automatic per character unless already configured.

## Run

```bash
# either the console script:
charactermemory-server

# or explicitly with uvicorn:
uvicorn character_memory.server:app --reload
```

A few flags are available on the console script (the env-var equivalents are
listed below and also work when launching through uvicorn directly):

| Flag                     | Default     | Purpose                                            |
|--------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `--host HOST`            | `CM_HOST` or `0.0.0.0` | Bind host.                                 |
| `--port PORT`            | `CM_PORT` or `8000` | Bind port.                                    |
| `--reload` / `--no-reload` | on        | Toggle uvicorn auto-reload.                        |
| `--meter`                | off       | Print HTTP request and per-memory retrieval times. |
| `--rebuild-kg [NAME…]`   | _unset_     | Rebuild a character's KG at startup (see below).   |
| `--api-key KEY`          | _unset_     | Require this API key on every endpoint (see below).|

The server reads its configuration from environment variables (the same ones
the rest of the library uses):

| Variable           | Default            | Purpose                                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL`  | OpenAI API         | Chat-completions endpoint used for extraction.           |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`   | _empty_            | API key for the above.                                   |
| `OPENAI_MODEL`     | `gpt-5.4-mini`     | Model used for extraction.                               |
| `OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_BASE_URL` | OpenAI API | Embeddings endpoint.                             |
| `OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL`    | `text-embedding-ada-002` | Embeddings model.                         |
| `OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Separate embeddings credential; explicitly empty disables key sharing. |
| `CM_STORAGE_BACKEND` | `sqlite` | `sqlite` or `postgres`. |
| `CM_DATABASE_URL` | _empty_ | Connection URL for an existing PostgreSQL database. |
| `CM_RETRIEVAL_BACKEND` | `hybrid` | Local FAISS/BM25 (`hybrid`) or PostgreSQL search (`postgres`, requires PostgreSQL storage and pgvector). |
| `CM_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Console command bind host; overridden by `--host`. |
| `CM_PORT` | `8000` | Console command bind port; overridden by `--port`. |
| `CM_METER` | off | Set to `1` to print request timings to the console. |
| `CM_TEMPORAL_RESOLUTION_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable automatic temporal recall.                 |
| `CM_TEMPORAL_RESOLUTION_ENGINE` | `dateparser` | Local fast engine; set `llm` to opt into one model call. |
| `CM_TEMPORAL_RESOLUTION_TIMEZONE` | `UTC` | IANA timezone for “yesterday”/calendar boundaries. |
| `CM_TEMPORAL_RESOLUTION_WEIGHT` | `1.0` | Temporal recall-score contribution (`0..1`).       |
| `CM_TEMPORAL_RESOLUTION_LANGUAGES` | _empty_ | Comma-separated ISO language codes.            |
| `CM_TEMPORAL_LLM_BASE_URL` / `API_KEY` / `MODEL` | main LLM settings | Dedicated endpoint for `engine=llm`. |
| `CM_ASSETS_DIR`    | `./assets`         | Root folder scanned for character subdirectories.        |
| `CM_SAVE_DIR`      | `./.cm_servers`    | Where each character's SQLite store + indexes live.      |
| `CM_REBUILD_KG`    | _empty_            | Comma-separated character names to rebuild at startup, or `all`. |
| `CM_API_KEY`       | _empty_            | Require this API key on every endpoint (comma-separated list allowed). |

Both `CM_ASSETS_DIR` and `CM_SAVE_DIR` are relative to the **current working
directory** (the server has no notion of a repo root once installed).
`CM_HOST` and `CM_PORT` apply to `charactermemory-server`; when running uvicorn
directly, use uvicorn's own host/port options.

Run `charactermemory-server --meter` to print a line such as
`[meter] POST /context 200 123.45 ms` for each completed HTTP request,
including MCP and admin calls. Timings include the full streamed response and
any in-process response background tasks; open event streams are logged when
they close. Failed requests are logged too. Query strings are omitted.
Metering works with both `--reload` and `--no-reload`.

Context building also prints one line per memory retrieved, for example
`[meter] POST /context character='Kurisu' memory='user_facts' 12.34 ms`.
This measures each memory's recall and initial formatting, including all
participants in a group chat. Empty results and failed retrievals are timed;
disabled memories and retrievals skipped by a zero global budget are omitted.
Shared temporal query resolution, global reranking, and final context assembly
are included only in the overall request time. These per-memory lines apply to
context building, including context previews and answer generation.

Memory lines can carry a nested phase breakdown in brackets, e.g.
`[meter] POST /context character='Kurisu' memory='knowledge_graph' 908.96 ms [activation=108.2ms embed=700.1ms]`.
`embed` is wall time spent inside embedding-endpoint HTTP calls (nested
inside the recall), `activation` the knowledge graph's spreading/BLL
computation; the unlisted remainder is lexical/dense search CPU, rendering
and budget selection. A line whose total is dominated by `embed` points at
the embedding endpoint, not at the retriever.

Per-character `config.yaml` can override the same feature under
`temporal_resolution:`. The server enables the local `dateparser` engine by
default; the LLM engine remains inactive unless explicitly selected. See
[the temporal-resolution guide](../../docs/temporal_resolution.md).

### API key authentication

Optional, off by default. Set `CM_API_KEY` (env var, `.env`, or the
`--api-key` flag) to require a key on **every** endpoint — the thin-client
API (`/`, `/context`, `/save`), the memory browser and admin endpoints
(`/api/...`), and the MCP endpoint (`POST /mcp`):

```bash
CM_API_KEY=change-me charactermemory-server
# or several keys (any one of them passes — handy for rotating or issuing
# one per client):
CM_API_KEY=gui-key,mcp-key charactermemory-server
# or equivalently:
charactermemory-server --api-key change-me
```

A request presents its key in any of three forms (first one found wins):

| Form                                | Typical client                                    |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header | HTTP API clients, MCP clients (`headers` config) |
| `X-API-Key: <key>` header            | the browser GUI's fetches                        |
| `?api_key=<key>` query parameter     | SSE `EventSource` and header-less clients        |

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer change-me' http://localhost:8000/
curl 'http://localhost:8000/?api_key=change-me'
```

Details:

- Unauthenticated requests get a plain `401` with a `WWW-Authenticate:
  Bearer` header (what streamable-HTTP MCP clients expect — not a JSON-RPC
  envelope).
- `/gui` and its `/gui/static/*` assets stay **public**: the page shell
  ships in the package and holds no user data. It loads, detects the `401`
  on its first data call, prompts for the key (🔑 button in the top bar)
  and attaches it to every request from then on. The key is stored in the
  browser's `localStorage`.
- The `?api_key=` fallback exists because `EventSource` cannot send
  headers; query strings can end up in access logs, so prefer the headers
  whenever the client supports them.
- MCP clients that support custom headers pass the key like this:
  `{"url": "http://host:8000/mcp?character=Kurisu", "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer change-me"}}`.
- Keys are compared with `hmac.compare_digest`; this is a shared-secret
  gate for exposing the server beyond localhost, not a hardened
  multi-tenant auth system.

### Characters

At startup the server scans `CM_ASSETS_DIR` and builds one `CharacterAgent`
per subdirectory. Each folder name becomes the character name clients send
in requests. For example:

```
assets/
└── Kurisu/          -> character name "Kurisu"
    ├── Information/
    ├── Dialogues/
    └── ...
```

Use `GET /` to list the characters the server has loaded.

### Rebuilding a knowledge graph

A character that opts into the knowledge-graph memory (via a
`.knowledge_graph` marker file in its folder or `CM_KG_CHARACTERS`) loads its
graph from the persisted `kg_index` on a plain start — it is **not** rebuilt.
To force a fresh build — e.g. after editing the wiki / `Information/*.md`,
changing the extractor, or wiping the store — pass `--rebuild-kg`:

```bash
# rebuild Kurisu's KG at startup, then serve (reload is disabled by default
# so the expensive LLM extraction pass runs exactly once):
charactermemory-server --rebuild-kg kurisu

# rebuild several characters:
charactermemory-server --rebuild-kg Kurisu Mayuri

# rebuild every KG-enabled character:
charactermemory-server --rebuild-kg
```

Names are matched case-insensitively. A character requested via `--rebuild-kg`
that does not have the KG memory enabled is logged and skipped (it is not
silently enabled). Without `--reload`, auto-reload is turned off automatically
when `--rebuild-kg` is used; pass `--reload` explicitly to override that.

The equivalent environment variable is `CM_REBUILD_KG` (comma-separated names,
or `all`), which also works when launching through uvicorn directly.

## Endpoints

### Memory browser and editor

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/memories/{character}` | List memory systems, counts, users, and editability. |
| `GET` | `/api/memories/{character}/{memory}` | Page/search records and return the WebUI form schema. |
| `POST` | `/api/memories/{character}/{memory}` | Add a record using `{ "values": { ... } }`. |
| `PUT` | `/api/memories/{character}/{memory}/{record_id}` | Update the submitted fields on a record. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/memories/{character}/{memory}/{record_id}` | Remove a record. |

Structured-memory writes refresh and persist the hybrid retrieval index. The
API returns `405` for derived/read-only memories.

### `GET /`

List available characters.

**Response** `200`
```json
{ "characters": ["Kurisu"] }
```

---

### `POST /context`

Resolve the chat (creating it if `chat_id` is missing or unknown), persist
the user turn, and return the assembled memory context for the character +
user.

**Request body**

| Field          | Type             | Required | Notes                                                        |
|----------------|------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `character`    | string           | yes      | A subfolder of `assets/` (e.g. `"Kurisu"`).                  |
| `user`         | string           | yes      | The user this chat belongs to.                               |
| `message`      | string           | yes      | The user's latest message.                                   |
| `chat_id`      | string           | no       | Existing chat id. If absent or unknown, a new chat is created. |
| `budget`       | integer or null  | no       | Global memory token cap. Omit to inherit configuration; `null` removes the cap; `0` omits memories. |
| `memory_types` | list[str] or null| no       | Specific memory names to recall (e.g. `["user_facts", "episodic"]`). Omitted memories bypass recall to save latency. `memories` is accepted as an alias. |

For example, this request selects whole memory items within 3000 tokens:

```json
{"character": "Kurisu", "user": "francesco", "message": "What did we discuss about robotics?", "budget": 3000}
```

Or to retrieve only specified memory types to save latency:

```json
{"character": "Kurisu", "user": "francesco", "message": "What did we discuss about robotics?", "memory_types": ["user_facts", "episodic"]}
```

The budget includes rendered memory headers, timestamps, speaker labels and
separators. Intermediate `prompt:<id>` blocks are excluded. Existing per-memory
retrieval limits still determine the candidates, and the override applies only
to this request. Negative values, booleans, strings and floating-point numbers
return HTTP `422` before a chat or message is written. The Python HTTP client
also accepts `client.context(..., budget=3000, memory_types=["user_facts"])` (and its `get_context` alias).

The server uses its configured/default reranker and tokenizer; these are
Python injections, not JSON request fields. See the
[memory budget guide](../../docs/memory_budget.md) for selection and token
counting details. The HTTP response shape is unchanged: token usage fields
are currently available only on the library's `ContextSnapshot`.

**Response** `200` — `ContextResponse`
```json
{
  "chat_id": "9b3f1c2a4d5e6f708192...",
  "context_order": ["character_info", "prompt:style", "dialogue_style"],
  "context_text": "## Character Information\n...\n\nUse these examples only for style.\n\n## Example Exchanges...",
  "memories": {
    "character_info": [
      {
        "text": "Kurisu is a gifted neuroscientist.",
        "score": 0.82,
        "kind": "character_info",
        "metadata": {"source": "Information/profile.md"}
      }
    ]
  },
  "context": {
    "character_info": "## Character Information\n...",
    "prompt:style": "Use these examples only for style.",
    "dialogue_style": "## Example Exchanges (style reference)\n..."
  }
}
```

The `context` object maps each enabled, non-empty memory name to its
rendered section. Character Studio can also insert verbatim intermediate
prompt blocks between memories; those use stable `prompt:<id>` keys. Empty or
disabled items are omitted. Typical memory keys:

`context_order` is the authoritative item order, including intermediate
prompts. `context_text` is the same content already joined with blank lines,
ready to pass to an LLM without relying on JSON object key ordering. `memories`
contains the exact retrieved `MemoryItem`s used for each rendered memory
section, grouped by memory name; each item includes its `text`, retrieval
`score`, `kind`, and backend `metadata`. Intermediate `prompt:<id>` blocks do
not appear in `memories` because they are authored prompt text, not retrievals.

| Key                | Memory contents                                         |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `character_info`   | Background lore / wiki passages about the character.    |
| `dialogue_style`   | Example exchanges used as a style reference.            |
| `user_facts`       | Facts the character has learned about this user.        |
| `user_directives`  | Standing instructions the user has given.               |
| `episodic`         | Past episodes with this user.                           |
| `heartbeat`        | Character-scoped recent activity / discoveries.         |
| `emotion`          | Current emotional state vector.                         |

**Errors**

| Status | When                                                                    |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `404`  | `character` is unknown, or `chat_id` was supplied but doesn't exist.    |
| `403`  | `chat_id` exists but belongs to a different `user`.                     |

---

### `POST /save`

Persist the assistant answer for a chat and run memory extraction over it.

**Request body**

| Field     | Type   | Required | Notes                                                |
|-----------|--------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `chat_id` | string | yes      | The chat id returned by `/context`.                  |
| `answer`  | string | yes      | The assistant answer to persist.                     |

**Response** `200` — `SaveResponse`
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "chat_id": "9b3f1c2a4d5e6f708192...",
  "extracted": true
}
```

`extracted` reports whether memory extraction actually fired for this turn
(the agent throttles extraction by `MemoryConfig.extract_interval`, so a
single turn may not always trigger learning). Forcing the client's answer
through this endpoint is what makes the character remember the exchange.

**Errors**

| Status | When                                       |
|--------|--------------------------------------------|
| `404`  | `chat_id` is unknown to any character.     |

    chat_id = ctx["chat_id"]

    answer = my_llm(ctx["context"], message)  # your own model call

    requests.post(f"{base}/save", json={"chat_id": chat_id, "answer": answer})
    return answer
```

---

## Notes

- **Chat ids are globally unique** UUIDs, so `/save` does not require the
  character name — it locates the chat across all loaded characters.
- **Persistence:** the user message is stored by `/context` and the
  assistant answer by `/save`, so the chat history is durable across
  server restarts. Structured-memory indexes are persisted to
  `CM_SAVE_DIR/<character>/` and flushed on shutdown.
- **This is an example server**, not a hardened production server: auth is
  opt-in via `CM_API_KEY` / `--api-key` (see "API key authentication" above)
  and off by default, and there is no rate limiting or concurrency control
  around the underlying SQLite store. For multi-worker deployments, give each
  character a single writer.

---

## Memory browser GUI

A read-only single-page GUI for browsing what a character has learned. Open it
in a browser at:

```
http://localhost:8000/gui
```

The page is served by the same FastAPI app (no separate frontend server, no
build step) and talks to the JSON endpoints below. It is **modular per memory
type**: each memory (`user_facts`, `episodic`, `emotion`, `character_info`, …)
has its own card renderer, keyed by memory name in `app.js` (`RENDERERS`), with
a per-`kind` fallback (`structured` / `rag` / `emotion` / `generic`) so a new
memory type still renders before it gets a tailored view.

Features:

- **Sidebar** — one entry per memory with a live record count; filter by name.
- **Pagination** — large memories page `size` records at a time (default 25,
  max 100) with windowed page numbers; pages are cached client-side so
  back/forward is instant.
- **Search** — per-memory query box (debounced). Prefers the memory's hybrid
  (semantic) retrieval and **falls back to lexical matching when the embedding
  server is unreachable**, so search still works offline.
- **User filter** — for per-user memories (facts / directives / episodes /
  emotion), narrow to one user.
- **Type-specific views** — confidence/importance/effective bars for facts,
  signed emotional-shift bars for episodes, per-user emotion bars + a baseline
  banner, rendered markdown for wiki chunks, etc.
- Skeleton loaders + request cancellation keep it feeling snappy.
- **Live recall monitor** — open `/gui?tab=live&character=Kurisu` to watch
  successful `POST /context` requests arrive over SSE. Each request shows the
  exact recalled items in collapsible memory drawers and, when the knowledge
  graph contributed, the captured activation field. The monitor keeps the
  latest 25 events per character in memory for the current server session; it
  does not add a second durable chat log.
- **Iframe knowledge graph** — the Live recall header links to
  `/gui/embed/knowledge-graph?character=Kurisu`, a read-only, chrome-free view
  that always follows the newest `/context` activation. It is designed for a
  portrait iframe and has one top button that opens the latest request's
  recalled-memory list.

Keyboard: `/` focuses search, `Esc` clears it.

If the server runs with `CM_API_KEY` set, the GUI prompts for the key on
the first rejected request (or via the 🔑 button in the top bar), stores it
in `localStorage` and attaches it to every request — headers for fetches,
`?api_key=` for the SSE live stream.

### `GET /gui`

The HTML page. Static assets (`styles.css`, `app.js`) are served from
`/gui/static/`.

Use `?tab=live&character=<name>` to deep-link directly to the live recall
monitor. The browser reconnects automatically if the SSE connection drops.

### `GET /gui/embed/knowledge-graph`

Minimal live knowledge-graph surface intended to be embedded directly:

```html
<iframe
  src="http://localhost:8000/gui/embed/knowledge-graph?character=Kurisu&user=alice&theme=dark&color_bg=101522"
  title="Live memory activations"
></iframe>
```

The route shares the same SSE event and canvas renderer as Live recall, shows
only the newest activation field, and explicitly allows framing. The top
**Recalled memories** button opens a vertically scrolling drawer containing the
items returned by the latest `/context` request. Group chats get a participant
selector only when more than one graph is present.

The optional `user=<id>` selector matches the current speaker exactly and
case-sensitively. It filters replay and future SSE events and keeps only that
speaker's graph entry from a group event. When omitted, the stream remains the
unrestricted administrative monitor. The graph snapshot itself follows the
character's configured `none`, `exclude`, or `private` knowledge-graph policy.

Iframe-only appearance options are `theme=system|light|dark`,
`repulsion=500..8000`, `link_distance=30..220`, `gravity=0..0.06`,
`particle_speed=0..3`, `label_zoom=1.2..4`, `toolbar=0|1`, and `recalls=0|1`.
The full graph palette is available through `color_bg`, `color_label`,
`color_label_shadow`, `color_ink`, `color_muted`, `color_muted_edge`,
`color_self`, `color_person`, `color_fact`, `color_episode`, `color_entity`,
`color_node`, `color_relation_edge`, `color_fact_edge`, `color_episode_edge`,
`color_transition_edge`, `color_cooccurrence_edge`, and `color_edge`. Colors
must be six-digit hexadecimal values, with an optional leading `#`; URL-encode
a literal `#`. Numeric values are clamped, invalid values are ignored, and
URL values override local storage for that iframe without changing persisted
GUI settings.

With `CM_API_KEY` enabled, a same-origin browser session reuses the key already
stored by the normal GUI. A host that cannot use that storage may append
`&api_key=<key>` to the iframe URL; as with the SSE fallback, query-string keys
can appear in access logs.

### `GET /api/context-events/{character}`

Server-Sent Events stream for the live recall monitor. The stream replays the
current in-memory session history (up to 25 events), then emits one `context`
event after each successful `POST /context`. Events include the request
metadata, the weighted retrieval query, each recalled memory's rendered section
and items, and a capped graph payload built from the activation trace captured
during that same recall. Pass optional `user=<id>` to receive only events whose
current speaker matches exactly; omission preserves the unrestricted stream.
The `/context` response remains backward-compatible and also exposes those
retrieved items under its `memories` field.

This broker is process-local and intended for the documented single-worker
server. It is not a durable or multi-worker event transport.

---

### `GET /api/memories/{character}`

Sidebar overview: every memory with its record count and known users.

**Response** `200`
```json
{
  "character": "Kurisu",
  "memories": [
    { "name": "user_facts", "title": "User Facts", "kind": "structured",
      "enabled": true, "count": 31, "users": ["francesco"] },
    { "name": "character_info", "title": "Character Information", "kind": "rag",
      "enabled": true, "count": 93, "users": [] },
    { "name": "emotion", "title": "Emotion", "kind": "emotion",
      "enabled": true, "count": 1, "users": ["francesco"] }
  ]
}
```

**Errors** — `404` if `character` is unknown.

### `GET /api/memories/{character}/{memory}`

One page of records for a memory.

**Query params**

| Param  | Type | Default | Notes                                                       |
|--------|------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `page` | int  | `1`     | 1-based (`≥ 1`).                                            |
| `size` | int  | `25`    | Page size (`1..100`).                                       |
| `user` | str  | _none_  | Filter to one user id (per-user memories only).             |
| `q`    | str  | _none_  | Search query. Semantic when the embedder is up, else lexical. |

**Response** `200`
```json
{
  "character": "Kurisu", "memory": "user_facts", "title": "User Facts",
  "kind": "structured", "enabled": true,
  "page": 1, "size": 25, "total": 31, "pages": 7,
  "search": false, "query": "", "user": null,
  "users": ["francesco"],
  "records": [
    {
      "id": 1, "user_id": "francesco",
      "text": "[user_name] The user's name is Francesco.",
      "score": 0.47,
      "fields": { "id": 1, "type": "user_name", "content": "…",
                  "confidence": 0.9, "importance": 0.5, "…": "…" },

                "last_recalled": 1783758429.8 }
    }
  ],
  "extra": {}
}
```

Each `record` carries: `text` (default display string), `fields` (the raw,
type-specific columns a custom renderer can read), `score` (search relevance in
search mode, effective-importance otherwise), and `meta` (decay/recency
bookkeeping for structured memories). For `emotion`, `extra.baseline` holds the
character's resting-state vector.

**Errors**

## MCP endpoint

The same FastAPI app exposes an [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
endpoint at `POST /mcp?character=<name>[&tools=<categories>]` that lets MCP clients
(Claude Desktop, MCP Inspector, the Python `mcp` client, …) **read and
edit** a character's memories. It speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 — the JSON-mode
subset of MCP's Streamable HTTP transport. No new dependency: the
protocol surface we need (`initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`,
`ping`, `notifications/initialized`) is implemented directly on top of
FastAPI in [`mcp.py`](./mcp.py).

When the server runs with `CM_API_KEY` set (see "API key authentication"
above), this endpoint requires the key too: pass an
`Authorization: Bearer <key>` header — most streamable-HTTP MCP clients have
a `headers` config field for it — or `X-API-Key`, or the `?api_key=`
query parameter for header-less clients. A failed check is a plain HTTP
`401`.

### `POST /mcp?character=<name>[&tools=<categories>]`

The query parameter `character` (required) names the `CharacterAgent`
every tool call operates against — it must match a folder scanned by
`CM_ASSETS_DIR` at startup (`GET /` lists them).

The optional `tools` parameter selects a comma-separated union of tool
categories. It filters both `tools/list` and `tools/call`, so a client cannot
invoke a tool hidden by its configured URL. Omit it, or use `tools=all`, for
the complete registry.

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| `core` | Memory overview and cache refresh. |
| `memory` | Generic memory search plus structured/RAG read-write operations. |
| `heartbeat` | Heartbeat journal list, search, and CRUD tools. |
| `events` | Immutable event search/fetch/neighbors plus temporal calculations. |
| `kg` | Graph overview/search/deduplication, node fetch/neighbors, plus temporal calculations. |

Tools may belong to more than one category: `resolve_time_range` and
`calculate_time_difference` are included by either `events` or `kg`, and the
heartbeat list/search/CRUD tools are included by both `memory` and `heartbeat` for
backwards compatibility. For example,
`/mcp?character=Kurisu&tools=heartbeat` exposes only the heartbeat journal
tools. Category names are case-insensitive and duplicates are ignored. An
empty or unknown selection returns HTTP 400 with JSON-RPC code `-32602`;
calling a registered tool outside the selected categories returns a normal
JSON-RPC `-32602` error envelope.

The body is a JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope (single object, or an array for
batches). Every successful / failed tool call returns a regular JSON
envelope; the route never returns FastAPI's `{"detail": …}` shape
even on URL-level errors so MCP clients can parse it.

**Envelopes** (single):

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/call", "params": {
    "name": "search_memory",
    "arguments": { "memory": "user_facts", "query": "coffee", "limit": 5 }
}}
```

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": {
    "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "{\"memory\":\"user_facts\",...}" }],
    "isError": false
}}
```

Errors come back either as a **JSON-RPC error envelope** (protocol
problems: `code` is one of `-32700 / -32600 / -32601 / -32602 / -32603`)
or as a **tools/call result with `isError: true`** (tool-level failure:
missing row, wrong memory type, bad timestamp, …).

### Tools

`tools/list` returns the schemas; each tool is precisely typed with a
JSON-schema so LLM introspection surfaces real choices (the `memory`
field is an enum of the loaded agent's memories). New tools are added in
`mcp.py` by one `_register(…)` call — methods + schemas + handlers
register themselves at module import.

| Tool                    | Writes to         | Notes                                                                       |

| `set_user_summary`      | `user_summary`    | `user_id`, `summary`, optional `name`, `aliases`, `importance`.              |
| `set_character_emotion` | `emotion`         | Absolute character-wide `current_mood`; no `memory` or `user_id` required.   |
| `get_character_emotion` | _read-only_       | Character resting baseline and persisted current mood.                       |
| `set_user_emotion`      | `emotion`         | `user_id`, optional signed `deltas`, absolute `current_mood`, and optional `comment`. |
| `get_user_emotion`      | `emotion`         | `user_id`. Returns baseline + current mood + per-user dims + relationship comment. |
| `add_character_info`    | `character_info`  | `text`, optional `source`. Session-scoped — see caveat below.               |
| `add_dialogue`          | `dialogue_style`  | Same caveat as `add_character_info`.                                         |

`search_memory` accepts a `date_from` / `date_to` timestamp range. The
dedicated `search_memory_by_date` tool accepts a calendar date
(`YYYY-MM-DD`) and an optional IANA timezone (default `UTC`), and searches
the half-open local-day range so daylight-saving transitions are handled
correctly. Date filtering is honoured on memories whose rows carry `created_at`
(`user_facts`, `user_directives`, `episodic`, `heartbeat`,
`user_summary`) and silently ignored on the others
(`character_info`, `dialogue_style`, `emotion`). Bad ISO 8601 input
returns `isError: true`; an inverted range
(`date_from > date_to`) returns `isError: true` rather than an empty
result.

### Write plumbing

Every write tool commits through the memory's own primitive
(`Add.Fact`, `episode`, `Directive`, heartbeat `entry`,
`summary.add_or_update`, …) then calls `StructuredMemory.rebuild_index`
so the hybrid retriever ranks against the new text, and
`agent.persist_structured()` so the change survives a server restart.
Skipped when the embedder is down (a warning is emitted) or when the
memory rebuilds itself (`user_summary.add_or_update`).

The `add_character_info` / `add_dialogue` tools append to the in-RAM
hybrid index directly. **Caveat**: these RAG memories are normally
rebuilt from `<character>/Information/*.md` and
`<character>/Dialogues/*.md` on agent startup, so anything appended via
MCP is session-scoped — persistent edits belong in those files on
disk.

### Errors

| Status | When                                                                   |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `400`  | Missing `?character=` query parameter.                                  |
| `400`  | Empty/unknown `?tools=` category selection.                              |
| `404`  | Unknown character (one not in the loaded `AGENTS` dict).               |

| `422`  | Body parses but the JSON-RPC envelope is malformed.                    |

JSON-RPC-level errors (`method not found`, `invalid params`, …) are
returned in the response body as `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":...,"error":...}`
with the standard codes (`-32601`, `-32602`, …). Tool-level failures
(missing row, cross-table guard, bad date) are returned as `tools/call`
results with `isError: true` — see [`mcp.py`](./mcp.py) for the exact
envelope.

### Example: `search_memory` with date filter

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/mcp?character=Kurisu' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1,
        "method": "tools/call",
        "params": {
          "name": "search_memory",
          "arguments": {
            "memory": "user_facts",
            "date_from": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "date_to":   "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z",
            "limit": 10
          }
        }
      }'
```

### Example: event-only tool surface

The category selection belongs in the MCP client URL and therefore applies to
every request on that connection:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/mcp?character=Kurisu&tools=events' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1,
        "method": "tools/call",
        "params": {
          "name": "search_conversation_events",
          "arguments": {
            "query": "photography workshop",
            "occurred_from": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "limit": 8
          }
        }
      }'
```

Use `tools=events,kg` to expose both retrieval families while excluding the
generic memory CRUD tools.

### Example: `search_memory_by_date`

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/mcp?character=Kurisu' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1,
        "method": "tools/call",
        "params": {
          "name": "search_memory_by_date",
          "arguments": {
            "memory": "episodic",
            "date": "2024-07-17",
            "timezone": "Europe/Rome",
            "user_id": "francesco",
            "limit": 10
          }
        }
      }'
```

### Example: round-trip add/update/delete

```python
import requests, json

base = "http://localhost:8000"
char = "Kurisu"
def call(method, params):
    return requests.post(
        f"{base}/mcp?character={char}",
        json={"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": method, "params": params},
        timeout=10,
    ).json()

# Add one fact.
add = call("tools/call", {"name": "add_fact", "arguments": {
