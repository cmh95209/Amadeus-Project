"""FastAPI app exposing a two-step chat flow over `CharacterAgent`.

This is the optional server subpackage: install it with
``pip install charactermemory[server]`` (which pulls ``fastapi`` and
``uvicorn``), then run either with the console script::

    charactermemory-server

or with uvicorn directly::

    uvicorn character_memory.server:app --reload

The flow it implements is the typical "thin client" pattern:

1. ``POST /context`` — given a character name, a user id, a user message and
   an optional ``chat_id``, load (or create) the chat, persist the user turn
   (attributed to that speaker), and return the assembled memory context plus
   the (possibly new) chat id. The client uses that context to drive its own
   LLM call.

2. ``POST /save``  — the client comes back with the assistant answer it
   generated; this endpoint persists the assistant turn and runs memory
   extraction so the character learns from the exchange.

The ``user`` field is the **current speaker**. A chat can host several
speakers (a group chat): any caller holding the chat id may post as any
``user``, each turn is attributed to its speaker, and memories are extracted
per participant. A 1:1 chat behaves exactly as before — the ``user`` is the
single participant.

Characters are discovered from the ``assets/`` directory at startup: every
subdirectory of ``assets/`` (e.g. ``assets/Kurisu``) becomes an available
character keyed by its folder name. Override the assets root with the
``CM_ASSETS_DIR`` environment variable.

Optionally require an API key on every endpoint with the ``CM_API_KEY``
environment variable (or the ``--api-key`` flag of the console script):
unset/empty means no auth. See :mod:`.auth` for the accepted credential
forms (Bearer / X-API-Key header, ``?api_key=`` query parameter) and the
public ``/gui`` paths.
